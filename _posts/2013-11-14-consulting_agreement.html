    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Payment Terms</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The Consultant will invoice the Client at the end of every Billing Cycle for Services rendered. The Client shall pay the Fees set out in the invoice within seven (7) days of receiving the invoice, together with the goods and services tax if applicable, to the Consultant.

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <aside>This is cleverly written to protect both sides. The intellectual property that's created specifically for the client will be owned by the client. But the contractor's own libraries and utilities remain their own, free to be used on other client projects.</aside>
        The Client agrees and acknowledges that, as between the Parties, all Consultant's IPR shall be and remain the sole property of the Consultant and that the provision of the Services does not give the Client any ownership, interest or such other interest in or to such rights. All rights in respect of any modifications or alterations to the Consultant's IPR, whether carried out by the Consultant or the Client or their respective agents or contractors, shall be and remain the sole property of the Consultant. The Client acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement shall not in any way prevent the Consultant from providing services to other clients using the ideas, concepts, techniques, know- how and experience used hereunder or from developing products or services which might be similar to or competitive with the Consultant's IPR and/or the Foreground IPR.
      </li>
      <li>Except as expressly provided herein, the Client shall not, and shall procure all the Client's employees, contractors, agents and licensees not to, directly or indirectly,
        <ol>
          <li>rent, lease, distribute, sell, resell, assign, or otherwise transfer rights to the Consultant's IPR;</li>
          <li>remove any proprietary notices from the Consultant's IPR;</li>
          <li>publish or disclose to third parties any evaluation of the Consultant's IPR without the Consultant's prior written consent.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>During the Term, the Consultant grants to the Client and its contractors, agents and licensees a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and royalty-free licence to use the Consultant's IPR that have been used or embodied in or in connection with the Services solely for the purposes of using the Foreground IPR.</li>
      <li>The Client further agrees and acknowledges that, as between the Parties, until the Fees for each Billing Cycle is paid in full by the Client to the Consultant, all Foreground IPR created and/or developed by the Consultant during such Billing Cycle shall be and remain the sole property of the Consultant and that the provision of the Services does not give the Client any ownership, interest or such other interest in or to such rights. Subject to Clause 4.7, until the Fees for each Billing Cycle is paid in full by the Client to the Consultant, the Consultant grants to the Client and its contractors, agents and licensees a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and royalty-free licence to use the Foreground IPR created and/or developed by the Consultant during such Billing Cycle.</li>
      <li>Upon the full payment of the Fees of each Billing Cycle, the Consultant assigns absolutely and irrevocably to the Client all rights, interest, title and benefit in the Foreground IPR created and/or developed by the Consultant during such Billing Cycle.</li>
      <li>Upon the termination of this Agreement, subject to the full payment of the Fees and all monies due and payable by the Client under this Agreement, the Consultant grants to the Client and its agents and contractors a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free licence to use, modify, and create derivative works of the Consultant's IPR that have been used or embodied in or in connection with the Services solely for the purposes of using the Foreground IPR.</li>
      <li>Upon the termination of this Agreement, in the event that the Client fails to pay all Fees and other monies due and payable by the Client under this Agreement in full, the Consultant shall have the right to revoke any and all licences granted to the Client with respect to the Consultant's IPR and the Foreground IPR by giving written notice to the Client.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Suspension</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>

        <ol>
          <li>If the Client fails to pay any money due to the Consultant under this Agreement on or before the date on which the same falls due; or</li>
